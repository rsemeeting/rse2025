,"Mikkel Baun Kjærgaard & Miguel Campusano",SDU,,"<br><b>Mikkel Baun Kjærgaard</b> is a professor at the Software Engineering Section at the University of Southern Denmark. His research focuses on software engineering and data-science with applications in ubiquitous computing and cyber-physical systems. He has contributed with new methods for human sensing and data analytics and methods for the optimization of software qualities, including performance, usability, integration, energy efficiency, and privacy protection. This has, among others, led to important contributions to data science methods within robotics, logistics, and activity recognition.<br><br><b>Miguel Campusano</b> is an associate professor at the Software Engineering Section at the University of Southern Denmark. He conducts research in the area of software engineering for robotic development, specifically focusing on programming languages, model-driven development, and programming experience. He has developed languages and tools to program mobile robots, drones, and cobots. The focus of these tools is to increase both developers' productivity and their understanding of different robotic systems.",Welcome Talk / SDU Keynote,Software Engineering in robotics system from SDU perspective,Keynote,Tu.W,Tuesday 9th,09:00,45,09:45
