,Malte Langosz,German Research Center for Artificial Intelligence,Team Lead Software Backbone at the Robotics Innovation Center,"Dr. Langosz studied computer science at the University of Bremen. He joined the DFKI (German Research Center for Artificial Intelligence) in 2007. His work focused on software development of robotic simulations, motion controllers for legged robots, learning frameworks and evolutionary algorithms. His research focus was on utilizing evolutionary methods to evolve and optimize robotic kinematic structures and their controller. In 2019 he finished his Ph.D. with the title “Evolutionary Robotics”. Since then, he is the lead of the software backbone team with the goal to collect, maintain and provide software solutions developed in research projects.","Software development for kinematically komplex, autonomous robots at DFKI-RIC","The presentation will introduce the Robotics Innovation Center of the German Research Center for Artificial Intelligence (DFKI). It will focus on challenges that arise in the software development of kinematically complex robots in a scientific environment. On the one hand the presentation will cover aspects of the low-level control responsible for the motion control of robotics systems. Additionally, it will introduce the high-level robotic framework X-Rock and KiMMI SF. Finally, concepts that are implemented at the RIC to ensure software quality and robustness in a scientific environment are presented.",Keynote,Tu.K,Tuesday 3rd,14:30,60,15:30
