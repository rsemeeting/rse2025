,Gianluca Filippone,Gran Sasso Science Institute,,,Towards the realization of service-oriented multi-robot systems,"During the last years, multi-robot systems (MRSs) gained interest in many areas as versatile means for addressing complex tasks in various domains. MRSs realized through service robots that cooperatively perform useful tasks will increasingly operate within society and collaborate with humans to support everyday life tasks in various domains. However, it will soon be impractical to have robots that are each specialized in a specific task; instead, robots will be multi-purpose, i.e., they will have the capabilities to accomplish various tasks and their mission will be specified only after production in a subsequent “programming” phase.
To realize cooperative missions, robots, possibly from different vendors, are required to interoperate in such a way they can be provided with a mission specification and communicate with each other through interfaces that can suitably ""hide"" the internal robot technological stack. Moreover, by exploiting the interface layer of the robots, missions can be defined by non-domain expert users since the robot's skills are exposed on a higher abstraction level.
Given this setting, solving this ""interoperability problem"" of robots is a challenging task with many similarities to the service interoperability problems that have led to service-oriented architectures.
Abstracting robots' skills and exposing them as REST APIs will allow robots to interoperate in a service-oriented fashion and system designers to compose robots within missions as in service-oriented architectures.",Sessions & Discussions,Mo2,Monday 2nd,14:45,25,15:10
,Ruichao Wu,Fraunhofer IPA,,,Enhancing Robotic Systems: Elevating From Reliability To Robustness And Resilience In The Lifecycle Of Software Fault Management,"As robots are increasingly deployed across diverse scenarios, they require advanced technology and a broad range of hardware to meet the demands of applications. However, as robot systems grow more complex, the likelihood of failure increases. The traditional focus on reliability in software fault management is no longer sufficient. This presentation explores the paradigm shift towards robustness and resilience in managing software faults throughout the lifecycle of robotic systems.

To achieve that, I propose a framework that includes two synergistic processes: robot self-adaptation and human evolution. The framework performs monitoring and anomaly awareness to identify issues and perform cause analysis. If the cause can be autonomously addressed by the robot, it enters the self-adaptation process, applying self-recovery strategies to resolve the issue. This process enables the robot system to recover from failures, minimizing downtime and mitigating adverse impacts, thereby achieving resilience. Conversely, if the fault requires human intervention, it transitions to the evolution process, where developers resolve the problem based on the cause analysis provided by the framework, leading to software evolution and improved robustness.

I will also dive into the methodology behind the proposed framework by modelling the representation of mutual relationships among entities​ in the robot system. Attendees will gain insights into how these two interconnected process can lead to more reliable, robust, and resilient robotic systems.

Lastly, I welcome discussion and feedback since this research builds on the concept of my PhD topic.",Sessions & Discussions,Mo2,Monday 2nd,15:10,25,15:35

,Anna-Maria Meer,Fraunhofer IPA,,,Enhancing Mobile Robot Safety and Interaction in Public Spaces: A Testing Framework to Bridge the Gap Between Industrial Environments and Urban Deployments,"With advancements in mobile robot technology enabling deployment in public spaces, it has become crucial to ensure performance, safety, and seamless Human-Robot Interaction (HRI). Although mobile robots are frequently used in controlled industrial environments, their introduction to public settings remains uncommon due to complex, unforeseen scenarios and ambiguous public perceptions. To address these challenges, gain insights into factors driving human-robot-interaction quality, and derive future guidelines for robot providers and user for successful use of robots in the public space, we propose a modular testing environment comprising both hardware blocks and software modules. To ensure adaptability to various environments, test cases can be composed through an interactive GUI that allows the input of different categories (e.g. sensors, test standards, conditions) to create customized test scenarios. A set of modular hardware building blocks and 3D tracking equipment allows to construct matching physical test scenarios and analyse interaction situations. In order to address design and behavioral aspects of the robots, the GUI also includes recommendations towards these, which can enhance the public perception and perceived safety of pedestrians. The test environment is developed based on the expertise of the consortium members of the ”Roboter Kompetenz- und Interaktionscluster RoKit” project [1]. This interdisciplinary project aims to enhance the deploy ability of robots in public spaces by addressing various challenges, including legal, ethical, technical, economic, and safety aspects. While investigating the topics of perceived safety and norm-based testcases first, our long term goal is to create a test environment that can guide robot manufacturers and users to deploy safe, meaningful and well-received robots in public spaces.",Sessions & Discussions,Mo3,Monday 2nd,15:50,25,16:15
,Sam Wiest,University of Bremen,,,Simplifying Testing through Automated and Varied Environment Generation," The testing and validation of robots in simulation is often limited due to the challenge inherent in creating simulated environments and specifying the robot's tasks. This challenge is compounded by the broad variance of scenarios that the robot may have to face, forcing robot developers to consider variants of environments and tasks, which in turn increases the effort necessary for robust testing. 

        The Floorplan DSL aims to simplify this process by enabling developers to automatically generate varied simulated environments, to which task specifications are applied to reduce the effort of simulated testing. The composable and modular nature of the Floorplan DSL allows developers to include both static and dynamic features, building upon simple scenarios to create more complex ones. Related Gazebo plugins enable developers to easily apply and test on these features.

        This tutorial will demonstrate how the Floorplan DSL and its plugins can be used to perform automated navigation testing, using a digital twin of the SECORO lab. Starting with a simple floorplan, static and dynamic obstacles will be added to modify the complexity of the scenario.
        
        Future work on the Floorplan DSL includes additional Gazebo plugins that implement new door types and behavior.",Sessions & Discussions,Mo3,Monday 2nd,16:15,25,16:40
,Argentina Ortega,University of Bremen,,,Composable and Executable Scenarios for Simulation-Based Testing of Mobile Robots,"Few mobile robot developers already test their software on simulated robots in virtual environments or sceneries. However, the majority still shy away from simulation-based test campaigns because it remains challenging to specify and execute suitable testing scenarios, that is, models of the environment and the robots' tasks.  Through developer interviews, we identified that managing the enormous variability of testing scenarios is a major barrier to the application of simulation-based testing in robotics. Furthermore, traditional CAD or 3D-modelling tools such as SolidWorks, 3ds Max, or Blender are not suitable for specifying sceneries that vary significantly and serve different testing objectives. For some testing campaigns, it is required that the scenery replicates the dynamic (e.g., opening doors) and static features of real-world environments, whereas for others, simplified scenery is sufficient. Similarly, the task and mission specifications used for simulation-based testing range from simple point-to-point navigation tasks to more elaborate tasks that require advanced deliberation and decision-making. We propose the concept of composable and executable scenarios and associated tooling to support developers in specifying, reusing, and executing scenarios for the simulation-based testing of robotic systems. Our approach differs from traditional approaches in that it offers a means of creating scenarios that allow the addition of new semantics (e.g., dynamic elements such as doors or varying task specifications) to existing models without altering them. Thus, we can systematically construct richer scenarios that remain manageable.
We evaluated our approach in a small simulation-based testing campaign, with scenarios defined around the navigation stack of a mobile robot. The scenarios gradually increased in complexity, composing new features into the scenery of previous scenarios. Our evaluation demonstrated how our approach can facilitate the reuse of models and revealed the presence of errors in the configuration of the publicly available navigation stack of our SUT, which had gone unnoticed despite its frequent use.",Sessions & Discussions,Mo3,Monday 2nd,16:40,25,17:05

,Marie Farrell,University of Manchester,,,Robotics: A New Mission for FRET Requirements,Mobile robots are used to support planetary exploration and safety-critical environments such as nuclear plants. Central to the development of mobile robots is the specification of complex required behaviors known as missions.

,Marco Autili,University of L'Aquila,,,RobEthiChor: automated context-aware ethics-based negotiation in the robot domain,"The presence of autonomous decision-making systems is growing at a fast pace and it is impacting many aspects of our daily life. Designed to learn and act independently, they are capable of autonomous decision-making without human assistance. A major challenge for their successful deployment in our lives is integrating human-like ethical values into their decision-making process. Introducing ethics in the decision-making process raises a new challenge: how may systems interact should their ethical preferences differ? The absence of universal ethics implies that they need to reach an ethical agreement. To address this challenge, the RobEthiChor architecture supports a novel context-aware ethics-based negotiation approach in which autonomous robots utilize ethical profiles together with contextual factors and user status conditions to control their autonomy while collaboratively negotiating to reach an ethical agreement that satisfies the ethical beliefs of all parties involved. In this talk, I describe the RobEthiChor architecture and its full implementation in the robot domain, illustrating its practical applicability to showcase its relevance in real-world scenarios.

,Kishan Ravindra Sawant,University of Bremen,,,Knowledge-based Adaptation of Robotic Control and Estimation Architectures in the Presence of Uncertainty,"Uncertainty in the knowledge about the environment is often unavoidable, necessitating robot controllers to adapt to varying or partially unknown environment conditions. For instance, robot lifting an object of unknown weight should adjust the lifting force by estimating the physical properties of the object. Similarly, if a joint motor fails, the robot should still be able to complete the task. The control architecture facilitates this by monitoring expected behavior, modifying strategies, estimating uncertainties, and adapting accordingly.

General-purpose languages often requires explicit formulation of adaptation rules and lack support for interpreting decisions due to limited semantic understanding of functions and variables. Although existing DSLs and tool-chains offer functionalities like component composition, automatic controller parameter tuning, and code generation, they do not fully leverage the advantages of modelling for adapting control architecture based on the abstract task descriptions.

This work explores strategies of coordination and reconfiguration of control architecture by integrating controllers with monitors and estimation components using model-driven development. We present metamodels supporting various adaptation policies and demonstrate their concrete implementation in a box-lifting use case.",Sessions & Discussions,Tu2,Tuesday 3rd,10:05,25,10:30
,Juliane Päßler,University of Oslo,,,Template Decision Diagrams for Meta Control,"Decision tree classifiers (DTs) provide an effective machine learning
model, well-known for its intuitive interpretability. However,
they still miss opportunities well-established in software engineering that
could further improve their explainability: separation of concerns, encapsulation,
and reuse of behaviors. To enable these concepts, we introduce
templates in decision diagrams (DDs) as an extension of multi-valued
DDs. Templates allow to encapsulate and reuse common decision-making
patterns. We use a case study from the autonomous underwater robotics
domain to illustrate the benefits of template DDs for modeling and explaining
meta controllers, i.e., hierarchical control structures with underspecified
entities. Further, we implement a template-generating refactoring
method for DTs. Our evaluation on standard controller benchmarks
shows that template DDs can improve explainability of controller DTs
by reducing their sizes by more than one order of magnitude.",Sessions & Discussions,Tu2,Tuesday 3rd,10:30,25,10:55
,Maksym Figat,Warsaw University of Technology,,,Synthesis of robot system controllers based on formal specification,"Despite the availability of numerous tools, developing controllers for robotic systems remains a significant challenge, requiring expertise in software engineering, robotics, control, and artificial intelligence. To reduce the complexity of robotic systems, the field has moved from object-oriented to component-based approaches. However, the latter often neglects the formal specification of the system, resulting in architectures that are difficult to reuse. The model-driven approach was introduced as a solution to this problem.

During the seminar, Ph.D. Maksym Figat will present insights from his Ph.D. thesis (awarded by the Prime Minister of Poland), which focused on the automatic generation of controllers for robotic systems from the formal specification. The essence of his research was the development of a methodology for robotic systems based on a parameterized meta-model. This meta-model, when provided with appropriate parameters expressed in the Robotic System Specification Language (RSSL), is transformed into a specific system model. This methodology aims to establish a universal specification method for robotic systems using the Embodied Agent Approach (EAA) and Model-Driven Engineering (MDE), integrating the structure and activities of the system (expressed using Petri nets) into the architecture of robotic systems. This approach supports different stages of development, including verification and code generation, while balancing the level of detail in specifications to ensure cost-effectiveness and provide clear implementation guidance.

The seminar will further discuss design guidelines for robotic systems, emphasizing a ""black box"" approach to balance design flexibility with constraints, thereby improving the design process. It will show how this methodology can be extended and explore its potential development into a framework for the design of safety-critical robotic systems. The presentation will summarize the research methodology, the results, and their implications for robotic system design.",Sessions & Discussions,Tu2,Tuesday 3rd,10:55,25,11:20
,Nils Chur,Ruhr University Bochum,,,A Study of Controller Engineering in Robotics Software,"Embedded systems such as robots, coupling software components and physical hardware, are often safety-critical in, e.g., transportation, healthcare and manufacturing.  A robot's behavior depends heavily on its controller, which bridges between software and hardware.  Whereas control theory provides principles to guarantee stability and robustness when designing controllers under uncertainties, the design and testing of controllers in tools such as Matlab/Simulink do not account for the challenges of implementation. This leaves a notable gap in research: It is an open question how controllers are actually implemented and whether the guarantees offered by control theory remain valid for these implementations. 
To start filling this gap, we study real-world controller implementations to understand their characteristics.  We examine controller implementations in ROS2 (Robot Operating System) repositories on GitHub, provide an overview of common controller applications, analyze the implementations in terms of discretization, and gain insights into the verification and validation techniques used. 
Our study reveals that many applications in open source repositories fall into standardized control design tasks. The majority of control laws are based on continuous systems, and the manner of handling discretization appears to be ''ad hoc.'' Testing practices found in our dataset are insufficient, less than 50% conduct any testing at all, whether it is code-based or simulation-based testing.",Sessions & Discussions,Tu2,Tuesday 3rd,11:20,25,11:45

,Jude Gyimah,Ruhr University Bochum,,,featX: Controlled Robotic Configurations with Flexible Feature Binding,"ROS (robot operating system) is the de facto middleware for implementing robotic systems. Such systems often need to be customized---or configured---towards different execution environments, hardware, or non-functional properties, such as energy consumption.
Configuration options---a.k.a. features---can control a wide range of system functionalities. They can enable or disable, as well as calibrate (e.g., tweak or fine-tune) different parts of the software, ranging from whole subsystems over components to lines of code. Many features---i.e., their implementations in code---are also scattered across the codebase. Unfortunately, features often have intricate dependencies, which need to be managed. While simple configuration mechanisms exists in ROS, they are far from the state-of-the-art in configuration mechanisms, which centrally manage large configuration spaces supported by intelligent tooling. In addition, robotic systems require the consistent management of bindings. For instance, dynamic components can change at runtime, while static ones can only be bound once---leading to intricate dependencies that need to be assured to avoid undefined situations. We present the configuration-management system featX, which extends feature models as the state-of-the-art in software configuration with support for flexible feature binding. We contribute a novel feature-modeling language, a configurator, and tooling integrated with ROS.",Sessions & Discussions,We1,Wednesday 4th,10:40,25,11:05

,Momina Rizwan,Lund University,,,Integrating Recovery Strategies in Autonomous Robots: Challenges and Research Insights,"Ensuring the safety of autonomous robots is a challenging task. Runtime safety monitors help keep robots safe by monitoring externally observable software or hardware properties, such as sensor values, and taking actions to keep these values within a safe range. Inspired by DeROS, we developed a Domain-Specific Language ROSSMARie, to write safety specifications for robots to generate a safety monitor. In DeROS, the response to any safety rule violation is to bring the system to a complete stop. We improve on this by enabling more elaborate recovery actions to ensure the robot maintains safety while staying operational. For instance, when the system approaches the boundary of the safety range, corrective actions — such as slowing down, switching controllers, or modifying the task plan — are initiated.
In this talk, I will present various robot scenarios to highlight the practical challenges of introducing recovery strategies. I will also discuss key research questions to determine the optimal level of information shared between a safety monitor and the high-level planner of the robot to affect autonomous robot decisions, ensuring both safety and mission success.",Sessions & Discussions,We2,Wednesday 4th,13:50,25,14:15

Robots need to be autonomous but also be able to reliably achieve an objective. In that sense, robotic systems offer great scenarios for requirement specification and verification. The challenge lies in precisely modelling adaptability within the system and verifying adaptable requirements at runtime. To that end, we propose an event based approach to runtime verification for ROS2 based systems that aims to bridge the gap between dynamic requirements specification and runtime verification by monitoring the state of the system and creating discrete events which are sent to a mission controller.",Sessions & Discussions,We2,Wednesday 4th,14:15,25,14:40
,Diana Carolina Benjumea Hernandez,University of Manchester,,,A Verifiable Architecture for Robotic Autonomous Systems in Critical Domains,"This research presents an innovative approach to ensuring the safe operation of Robotic Autonomous Systems (RAS) in critical domains, focusing specifically on the UK nuclear safety regime as a case study. Motivated by the growing need to deploy robots in hazardous environments to enhance safety and efficiency, we aim to develop a systematic approach that demonstrates the feasibility of RAS deployment while ensuring that operational risk is tolerable and As Low as Reasonably Practicable (ALARP). The proposed framework involves deriving formal properties from functional safety requirements for RAS, developing rules-based Safety Instrumented Functions (SIFs), implementing them in the Safety System, and formally verifying compliance with these derived safety properties. Integration of these SIFs into operational RAS is facilitated by a system architecture that ensures the independence and functionality of both the safety and control systems. This approach is demonstrated through a real-world application in the UK nuclear industry, underscoring the importance of safety assurance throughout the entire life cycle of RAS, from hazard analysis to operational deployment and beyond.",Sessions & Discussions,We2,Wednesday 4th,14:40,25,15:05

,Kevin Hermann,Ruhr-University Bochum,,,"Engineering Security Features - Practices, Challenges, and Insights from Industry Professionals","Cyber-physical systems process a substantial amount of sensitive data and operate in safety-critical environments. As such, they are valuable assets for adversaries who threaten the security of such systems. Implementing Security Features - functionalities that mitigate these threats - is of utmost importance to reduce potential costs and harm. Consequently, the research community invests substantial effort into developing new security technologies that can keep pace with adversarial actors who continuously discover and exploit new vulnerabilities. We therefore significantly rely on assumptions that are largely based on common sense or individual examples, since we currently lack an empirical understanding of how security features are engineered in practice. However, common sense or intuition is not enough to better target our research efforts and make them more effective in practice.
Developers need to systematically select, plan, design, implement, and especially maintain and evolve security features. While there have been plenty of studies on the use of libraries (e.g., APIs of cryptography libraries), surprisingly little is known about how developers engineer security features. How do they select what security feature to implement in a given system? What is the process to design and implement security features? What challenges arise and what must be done to overcome them?
We interviewed knowledgeable industrial professionals involved in the engineering process of security features, exploring how they select and engineer them in practice. We identified key challenges and practices they use to overcome them.
In this talk, I will dive into the practices and challenges voiced by practitioners to give an overview over the current state of the engineering of security features in the industry while highlighting differences identified in the engineering of cyber-physical systems.

,Sara Pettinari,Gran Sasso Science Institute,,,Process-driven Development and Analysis of Multi-Robot Systems,"Multi-robot systems are emerging to perform complex tasks in different application domains, by supporting or automatizing human tasks. The behavioral workflow of these systems, referred to as mission, can be seen as a sequence of tasks enabling both robots’ actions and inter-robot interactions. Hence, considering robots’ behavior at a high level allows for conceptualizing their missions as process models. In the context of process models, Business Process Management (BPM) is the reference discipline that enables their usage to describe the overall workflow of a system, including its design, enactment, monitoring, analysis, and refinement.
Using process models in the robotics domain can leverage techniques from the BPM discipline. This talk will present a top-down approach, which involves designing processes to model robotic missions and facilitate their execution according to the planned sequence. Additionally, it will discuss a bottom-up approach, which uses data generated during robot operations to discover and analyze mission executions by applying process mining techniques to automatically extract insights related to multi-robot execution.",Sessions & Discussions,Th1,Thursday 5th,09:25,25,09:50

In addition to the tool, I will discuss the current developments towards supporting a low-code approach for the design, deployment and re-configuration of software stacks bringing situation understanding and deliberation capabilities to future intelligent robots.",Sessions & Discussions,Th1,Thursday 5th,10:15,25,10:40

,Christoph Reichenbach,Lund University,,,Finding Launch-Time Bugs with EzSkiROS,"When we develop general-purpose robot software components, we rarely know the full context that they will execute in. This limits our ability to make predictions, including our ability to detect program bugs early.  We propose a strategy for bug detection at launch time that can incorporate configuration and world-model information to identify bugs in (mostly) declarative parts of robot code, including code implemented in dynamic languages like Python.  We have implemented this strategy in EzSkiROS, a checker tool that sits on top of the skill-based knowledge integration tool SkiROS2.

In this talk, I will present a number of design patterns that we have identified as part of EzSkiROS and discuss their capabilities and limitations, as well as practical considerations on robot software engineering and launch-time bug detection.

,Tobias John,University of Oslo,,,Mutation-Based Integration Testing of Knowledge Graph Applications,"Robots operating in complex domains rely on knowledge about this domain. One representation for this knowledge are knowledge graphs (KGs). We present a novel testing approach for the integration of control software with KGs.
As the KGs are expected to change during the run- and lifetime of the control software, we must ensure the robustness of the whole system w.r.t. changes in the KG.  Starting with a singular KG, we mutate its content and test the unchanged software with the original test oracle. To address the specific challenges of KGs, we introduce two additional concepts. First, as generic mutations on single triples are too fine-grained to reliably generate a KG describing a different, consistent KG, we employ domain-specific mutation operators, that manipulate subgraphs in a domain-adherent way. Second, we need to specify the parts of the knowledge that the control software relies on for correctness. We introduce the notion of a robustness mask as graph shapes that the KG must conform to. We evaluate our approach on two software applications from the robotic and simulation domain that tightly integrate with their respective KG.",Sessions & Discussions,Th2,Thursday 5th,11:20,25,11:45
,Minh Nguyen,University of Bremen,,,Automated Behaviour-Driven Acceptance Testing of Robotic Systems,"The specification and validation process of robotics applications requires bridging the gap between the formulation of requirements and their systematic testing. This process frequently entails manual work known to be prone to errors, which becomes increasingly complex as the requirements, system design, and implementation evolve during development. To address this challenge systematically, we propose to extend behavior-driven development (BDD) as an effective method to define and verify acceptance criteria for robotic systems. To be effective in the robotics context, we employ domain-specific modeling and represent composable BDD models as knowledge graphs for robust model querying and manipulation, supporting the generation of executable testing models. For solution builders, a domain-specific language facilitates the efficient specification of robotic acceptance criteria. We discuss the potential for automated generation and execution of acceptance tests using a software architecture combining a BDD framework, Isaac Sim, and accompanying model transformations along the acceptance criteria for pick-and-place applications. This research paves the way for more rigorous and automated evaluation of robotic systems, ensuring they meet user-defined acceptance criteria.",Sessions & Discussions,Th2,Thursday 5th,11:45,25,12:10
